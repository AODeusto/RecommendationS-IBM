# Recommendations-IBM

## Motivation

Create a recommendation system for IBM users based on data about how users interact with articles. Rather than recommending just the top visited articles, the idea is to develop an engine able to personalize recommendations to users based on their previous interactions with other articles and the similarity with other users of the learning platform.

## Required libraries

- Python 3.6
- Pandas
- Numpy
- Matplotlib

## Files

- Recommendations_with_IBM.ipynb  Jupyte Notebook file with the development of an approach to recommending articles to users.
- Recommendations_with_IBM.ipynb.html     Same notebook in html format

## Notes

Thanks to [IBM Watson Studio platform](https://dataplatform.cloud.ibm.com/) for the data. I recommend to visit the site as it is a nice place to non stop learning about tech.
